		<h1>Hello everyone</h1>
		<p>I'm 15 years old Linux Enthuasist and Coder (maybe I'm not older and experienced enough to be called Programmer). Of course I also watch anime and playing games (osu!, anyone?). You can find my dotfile and scripts in my Github profile.</p><br>
		<p>As you can see, there's nothing in this website because I still working on my website and just upload this unfinished website to try web hosting feature in Github. Stay tuned</p>
